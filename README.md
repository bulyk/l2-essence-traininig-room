Remote start of the training zone. 
On some non-official L2 Essence servers there are restrictions on the use of remote access due to which it is not possible to start instance zones. 
This script will launch one of these zones.
For his work, unexpectedly, the arduino leonardo board based on atmega32.

How to start:
1. upload click2 sketch to arduino leonardo using arduino ide

3. adjust the time delays before actions depending on the speed of your PC in the training room.py file and run it. 
(at startup, the left corner of the game and the special icon should be visible)
